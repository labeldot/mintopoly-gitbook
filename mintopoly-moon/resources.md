# Resources

Resources are the in-game items that are generated by each base on a regular schedule. They come in numerous varieties (Silver, Moon Bricks, Infrastructure, Electricity, Water, Crops, Magic, Culture, and Influence).

These 9 resources form the basis of this lunar economy, with numerous current and planned uses that fit into the following categories:

**Land Purchases.** Unlike most NFTs, the Mintopoly Moon bases can be claimed and minted exclusively with these in-game resources. See "Claiming and Minting" section under NFT Moon Bases for details.

**Games.** As our lunar economy becomes more established, we plan on introducing various games and competitions where players can invest or wager resources in order to gain valuable upgrades and content.

**Account Upgrades.** Resources can be spent on items that upgrade your account, such as a permanent visa that gives you full access to the moonâ€™s exchange and land ownership. Additional account upgrades are likely to be made available in the future.

**Land Upgrades.** One of the first planned uses of resources are base upgrades. These may include everything from efficiency and storage improvements to customization and advertising options.
