# Initial Landrush

During the launch phase of the moon, the market will need to be kickstarted with resources so that players can purchase them with $MM to claim & mint land, and to begin supplying resources back to the economy. **Our target is to seed the market with enough resources to fund approximately 750 bases,** or about 10 million total resources across all types. Our current projection (which is subject to change) is to release 12 waves of 90,000 of each resource type, with each release split evenly across 6 price tiers as follows:

#### Release per Resource per Wave (12 Waves\* Total)

| Tier   | Price in MM | Quantity |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Tier 1 | 1           | 12,000   |
| Tier 2 | 1.5         | 12,000   |
| Tier 3 | 2           | 12,000   |
| Tier 4 | 4           | 12,000   |
| Tier 5 | 5           | 12,000   |
| Tier 6 | 6           | 12,000   |

_\*the 12 waves with 90,000 of each resource type may be spaced irregularly pending demand, but likely 2-3 per week for approximately one month._ \

As another measure to kickstart the market, approximately 200 pre-minted bases will be available for sale on OpenSea for those who would prefer to purchase bases directly with ETH rather than $MM. Like resources, these will likely be listed at several price tiers and several drops over time.
