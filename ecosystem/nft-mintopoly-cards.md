# NFT Mintopoly Cards

Mintopoly Cards are Ethereum-based NFTs (ERC1155 tokens) at the heart of Mintopoly. Each card provides numerous benefits for its owner - and we are continuously working to increase the cards' value and utility.&#x20;

In the simulator game, cards increase earnings or decrease the cost of a certain investment, provide extra starting capital, provide extra earnings per block, or boost total net worth. Plus, the **cards reduce the cost of unlocking the investment tier they represent by 25% (35% for founder's cards) – providing crucial early access to these higher-level investments.**

**On the moon, cards can be applied onto a plot of land to multiply its resource generation** – as well as providing special benefits like early access to testing new features.&#x20;

Cards are being minted in small editions of 20-30, but written into the smart contract are constraints that guarantee two facts: i) no card can have an edition size greater than 30 (other than #1 – Mintopolist – which has 50) and ii there can never be more than 12,000 of these base Mintopoly! cards minted in total – making them scarce and collectible.

### Purchasing Mintopoly Cards

{% hint style="info" %}
**There are currently two ways to purchase Mintopoly Cards –** 1) the [Mintopoly Cards on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/mintopoly) has a number of first and third-party cards for sale. 2) the "vending machine" allows you to connect with our smart contract to instantly receive individual cards or packs of cards.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Using the vending machine has a number of advantages:** 1) gas fees are significantly cheaper, 2) prices are typically lowest and fully support development of the game, and 3) pack purchases have a 1% chance per card of receiving a very rare and powerful founder's edition card.

### Key Facts of Mintopoly! Cards:

* There are 12 types of cards and each one provides a different type of boost (see all below)
* Players can only have one card of each type active in any given round.
* If you own more than one of any card of a type, the game will automatically activate the most valuable one before you begin playing.
* In order for a card to apply to a given round, they must be owned by your account before you first login to play that round. Cards purchased/added once you have started playing will not apply until the next round.
* Several "promo" Mintopoly! Cards exist (distinguished by a light grey BG). These are non-NFT, non-tradable cards given to players for special occasions. They typically have smaller bonuses than the true NFT Mintopoly! Cards. **NOTE: we recently launched our player achievement program where you can earn more promo cards for completing challenges in game. View your profile to see all available challenges!**
