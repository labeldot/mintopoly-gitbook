# Accounts & Login

Mintopoly is completely free to play. All you need to get started is an ETH address and a browser-based wallet to login securely. You'll never need a username and password, just access to your wallet –

### 1. Create a Crypto Wallet

If you're new to crypto, you can create a free wallet through a variety of browser plugins or mobile apps. We don't have a favorite, but some popular ones are MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. This only takes a minute or two.

**NOTE: always be sure to write down and save your wallet's seed phrase - your account cannot be recovered if you lose this.**

### 2. Login on Your Favorite Web Browser

Once you have your wallet on a mobile app or [browser extension](https://metamask.io/download), you can login to Mintopoly. We currently support three wallet options that allow you to connect and play from any web browser:

****[**WalletConnect**](https://walletconnect.com) - With this option, you can authenticate from your wallet on your mobile device (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and many others) directly to any web browser where you want to play Mintopoly. Choose the Wallet Connect option on your browser, then follow the on-screen instructions to link the QR code from your wallet.

****[**Coinbase Wallet**](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) - Coinbase Wallet provides a similar login method to WalletConnect. Click this option from your favorite web browser, then authenticate through the Coinbase Wallet app.  &#x20;

****[**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) **** - While MetaMask can be used through WalletConnect, if you have the [browser extension](https://metamask.io/download) installed in your browser or the mobile apps, you can authenticate and login directly.&#x20;

**COMING SOON - Email Login**. If you don't have a crypto wallet yet, we're working on a new method that allows you to create a temporary account with just your email address. Check back in Q1 2023 for more on this!
