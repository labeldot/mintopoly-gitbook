# ETH to Polygon Program

Mintopoly Money is an Ethereum-based token. That makes it highly secure and flexible, but it also means that gas fees are prohibitively high for most transactions. To address this, last fall we created a layer 2 token on the Polygon network to enable secure, decentralized, lightning-fast transactions that cost a fraction of a cent â€“ all while retaining access to the root Ethereum tokens. **We have been using the Polygon-based tokens exclusively for nearly a year now.** \


However, the initial several airdrops (4-5 million tokens) were done on ETH and we've initiated a program where you can convert your ETH MM to Polygon MM without having to use the bridge and pay significant gas fees. **If you would like to make this conversion, follow these steps**

1. Send us an email through our [contact form](https://www.mintopoly.io/contact) or DM on discord letting us know 1) your eth address and your intention to send the tokens
2. Send in your ETH-based MM to the Community Manager Wallet: 0xA1e6aF9979ddB7494261b1D05B2dB19b9fF48A08&#x20;
3. We will send you back (on Polygon) the amount sent plus 10% as an incentive to move all the tokens to Polygon. \
